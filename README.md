## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- SCSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The biggest challenge for me during this project was getting the background images in the right place. It was my first time using multiple background images as well as positioning them in specific places. Other than that, the project was some more practice coding from a design.

### Continued development

I will remember what I learned for the background images and use it going forward when I need to.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Using multiple backgrounds](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders/Using_multiple_backgrounds) - This helped me work out how to use multiple background images
- [MDN - background-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - This helped me with positioning the background images to custom properties.
